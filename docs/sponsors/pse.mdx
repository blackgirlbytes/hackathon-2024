# PSE's Challenge: ZKPs in SSI

<SponsorDetails sponsor={sponsors.find((s) => s.key === "pse")} />

### Overview

This track aims to foster innovation and collaboration among developers, researchers, and industry experts to advance the use of programable cryptography in digital identity solutions.

### Objectives

1. Innovate with ZKPs, MPC, FHE: Develop creative applications using programable cryptography to enhance privacy, security, and interoperability in SSI systems.
2. Collaborate and Learn: Engage with zkp experts to learn about best practices, existing tools, and solutions.

### Hack Ideas & Challenges

1. Solidity verifier for BBS+.
2. Build a [GPC](https://www.notion.so/6547d2e60c184ad0984f933672246e0b?pvs=21) builder + visualizer.
3. MPC for recovery (privacy-preserving social recovery system).
4. MPC for credentials that need to be issued by multiple parties.
5. Decentralized PKI infra.
