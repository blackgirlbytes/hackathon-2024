# Ontology's Challenge

<SponsorDetails sponsor={sponsors.find((s) => s.key === "ontology")} />

ONT Login is a decentralized universal authentication login component that helps developers shield the details of authentication implementation, and can quickly bring a Web 3.0 secure login experience to enterprises and services. It gives a great presentation of how reuseable identity can be applied in any Web2 / Web3 applications with the protection of users data and privacy. Currently, users need to log into the service via ONT ID. It is fully open source and supports multi-SDKs.

To optimize the developers’ building experience, as well as demonstrate its easy integration with any single app. We are inviting the developers to

- Make repo for the relevant technical documentation or its SDKs.
- Or provide a demo case for integrating ONT Login to their existing applications, say setting ONT Login as one of their user login methods.
