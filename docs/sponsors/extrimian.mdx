Secure Hotel Check-in System Using Verifiable Credentials (VC)

### Overview

Hotels handle sensitive guest information during the check-in process, making security a top priority. Your challenge is to design a secure check-in system for hotels that leverages **Verifiable Credentials (VC)** issued by the government. The government of the guest's country will issue a **VC Passport** for travelers, and when they check into a hotel, the hotel will verify their credential and check its status from a list (valid, invalid, or under review). This ensures a seamless, secure, and privacy-focused check-in process.

### Submission requirements

- Use **ID Connect by Extrimian** to create both the credential issuer (government) and verifier (hotel).
- The system must include the following components:
  - **Credential Issuer**: The government entity issues the VC Passport to the traveler.
  - **Credential Verifier**: The hotel validates the VC when a guest checks in, ensuring it is genuine and up-to-date.
  - **Status Check**: The system should check the credentialâ€™s status from a status list
  - Upon successful verification, the guest is cleared to check in.
