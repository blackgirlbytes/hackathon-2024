### Overview

This track invites participants to explore how decentralized identity, specifically leveraging DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials), can be applied to innovative use cases in **recruitment** and **reusable ID**.

Participants will utilize the Vidos tech stack and other tools from our partner network to build solutions that enhance security, efficiency, and user control in these domains.

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Employer Portal Using DIDs and VCs (Education track)

Develop a proof-of-concept ‘employer portal’ that enables recruiters to identify, verify, and onboard candidates through a seamless, decentralized identity system. The portal should integrate DID-based identity management and support the issuance and verification of VCs to streamline the hiring process.

Key features include:

- **Candidate Identification: **Use credentials such as education and skills-based certifications to match candidates to suitable roles.
- **Qualification Verification: **Implement secure methods to verify candidate qualifications and identity using VCs.
- **Onboarding Automation: **Create a user-friendly onboarding interface that leverages VCs for streamlined processes.
- **Innovative Training Paths: **Design training programs tailored to the skills of new hires, incorporating credential issuance.

Example use cases:

- Matching candidates to job openings based on verified skills and qualifications.
- Automating the verification of educational and professional credentials.
- Creating a marketplace for qualification issuers and recruitment agencies.

### Prizes

(Total of $2,250)

- **1st place:** $1,200, optional video podcast interview, promotion across our socials
- **2nd place:** $700, optional video podcast interview
- **3rd place:** $350

#### Challenge 2: VC Interoperability (Reusable ID track)

Develop a proof-of-concept solution that demonstrates the flexibility and interoperability of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) across multiple scenarios. Your solution should showcase how a single VC can be reused in different contexts, such as using a passport for both travel access and age-gated entry. Additionally, the solution should be capable of verifying similar credentials VCs from different issuers, e.g. passport credentials issued by different national authorities - highlighting the versatility of VCs in various real-world applications.

Key features:

- **Interaction with Issuer: **Integrate with a VC issuer (e.g., TBD) and leverage the Vidos tech stack to retrieve and verify the VC, ensuring seamless interaction between the issuer and the verifier.
- **Multiple Issuers: **Implement functionality to work with multiple VC issuers, creating and verifying credentials from different sources using the Vidos tech stack. This should demonstrate the interoperability of VCs across various issuers.
- **VC Verification: **Ensure that the solution accurately verifies the correct VC for the given scenario, maintaining high security and reliability standards.
- **User Design: **Design an intuitive interface that allows users to easily select which VC they wish to use in a given situation, enhancing the user experience and demonstrating the practical application of reusable VCs.
