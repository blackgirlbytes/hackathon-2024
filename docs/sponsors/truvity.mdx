# Truvity's Challenge: Enable Miko's Journey

<SponsorDetails sponsor={sponsors.find((s) => s.key === "truvity")} />

### Overview

This track invites participants to explore how decentralized identity and verifiable credentials can streamline complex eKYC processes and digital identity management using self-sovereign identity solutions. The challenges focus on building innovative applications that simplify the journey of individuals like Miko, an expat moving to Amsterdam, by leveraging digital wallets, to-do lists, and interlinked verifiable credentials.

To build the applications you need to leverage the Truvity SDK (available in TypeScript and Java).

### Challenges

#### **Challenge 1: Miko’s Journey to Amsterdam: Reusable Digital Identity for Expats**

**Challenge Description**

Miko, a talented backend developer from outside of Europe, is relocating to Amsterdam to join a small yet ambitious startup to develop a cutting-edge Self-Sovereign Identity solution. Amsterdam, the new Verifiable Credentials capital, has a relatively new requirement: all documents in legally-binding processes should be exchanged in the form of Verifiable Credentials between Digital Identity Wallets (both for businesses and retail users). Her Digital Identity Wallet with an embedded to-do list is the key to navigating the complex process of settling as an expat. The wallet's to-do list guides Miko through each step, ensuring that she gathers and submits all required verifiable credentials (VCs) from the right issuers.

The **to-do list** is pre-configured to:

- Know all necessary **issuers** and where to send collected credentials for verification and further actions.
- Ensure that some issuers, particularly for more complex processes, only accept **interlinked VCs**, meaning Miko can’t submit non-linked credentials, ensuring that the integrity of her data is maintained across all processes.

**_Note_**: The Municipality of Amsterdam fully controls the document issuance in Amsterdam, therefore all businesses and municipal workers must use the municipality's platform and issue VCs on its behalf.

**Miko's To-Do List:**

1. **Obtain an Employment Contract**

- VC: Employment Offer Letter
- The to-do list prompts Miko to receive and store this VC from her new employer.

2. **Apply for and Receive a Visa**

- VCs:
  - Proof of Identity
  - Employment Contract
  - Proof of Financial Stability
- **Drafts**: Allow Miko to begin the process while gathering necessary documents. The visa application can’t be submitted until all relevant VCs are linked.

3. **Register with the Municipality**

- VCs:
  - Employment Contract
  - Proof of Identity
  - Birth Certificate
- The to-do list automatically guides Miko through the residency registration process.

4. **Open a Bank Account**

- VCs:
  - Proof of Registration issued by the municipality
  - Employment Contract
  - Proof of Identity
- Bank institutions that are integrated with the wallet’s interlinked VCs require a full set of linked documents to open her account.

5. **Secure Housing and Sign a Rental Agreement**

- VCs:
  - Employment Contract
  - Proof of Identity
  - Bank Account Details
- The final task, completing her journey with signing a rental agreement, depends on all the previous linked VCs in her wallet.

**What we are looking for**:

- eKYC with Reusable Identity is a complex process involving many actors, processes, and documents. You can model the process from the perspective of an **Issuer** or a **Relying Party (Verifier)**, but the most interesting part would be building the **Expat Wallet** that orchestrates the entire flow using a pre-built **To-Do List**.
- We've created many features to simplify this journey. **Review them all** and use as many as possible in your solution.
- You don’t need to focus on the real content of the documents; feel free to model them with few fields found online.

#### **Challenge 2: eKYC: Compliance Officer Panel**

**Challenge Description**

Building on the journey in Challenge 1, this second challenge focuses on the role of a **Compliance Officer** in the process of verifying and approving the credentials Miko submits. You may model just a part of the whole process (as well as Miko's wallet, it shouldn't even have the UI).

In Step 4, Miko submits her documents to open a bank account. These documents include:

- Proof of Registration from the Municipality
- Employment Contract
- Proof of Identity
- Proof of Address

The task is to build a **simple Compliance Officer Panel (webpage)** where:

- Miko's submitted VCs are received by the bank's compliance officer.
- The compliance officer reviews the documents, approves or rejects them, and logs the decision.
- On approval, the officer issues a new VC (e.g., “Bank Account Information") and sends it back to Miko’s Digital Wallet.

**Key Features**:

- The panel allows the compliance officer to view and review interlinked VCs.
- The panel allows the compliance officer to search through received VCs and their content.
- The panel provides clear options for approval or rejection of each document.
- The VCs are interconnected, and documents can’t be reviewed or approved unless all linked VCs are present.

### Prizes

  - **1st place**: $1,500 USD
